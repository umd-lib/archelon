# Facet Field Presenter

## Summary

This document is meant to describe the process of updating https://umd-dit.atlassian.net/browse/LIBFCREPO-1709

Blacklight has a Presenter class to contain facet fields that need to be displayed, whether on the sidebar,
or through the modal popup window.

A part of the update was to seperate some of the logic when rendering facets in the sidebar vs in the modal

The filter facet component needed to have all options available when on the sidebar,
and then continue to be paginated when in the modal

The issue was that for facet values you can specify a limit to show how many facets can appear on the sidebar
but then if you remove it and then try to render the modal, it will continue to show all values, rather than be
paginated.

So the default facet presenter had to be overwritten, by copying the entire class from blacklight and placing it
in the respective place in Archelon.

The changes made were to check for if the modal was open or not, and then another change to use the blacklight
configuration's default more limit for showing the correct amound of facet options in the modal.

It could not be monkeypatch sadly, since Ruby could not find the original reference to the class when trying to
re open the class.
