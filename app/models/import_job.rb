# Model for metadata import jobs
#
# The "state" field records the current step in the processing of this job. The
# possible states are:
#
#   * :validate_pending - A "validate" request has been sent to Plastron, but
#                         no response has been received.
#
#   * :validate_success - A Plastron response was received indicating that the
#                         file is valid
#
#   * :validate_failed - A Plastron response was received indicating that the
#                         file was not valid
#
#   * :import_pending - An "import" request has been sent to Plastron, but
#                       no response has been received.
#
#   * :import_complete - All items in this import job have been successfully processed.
#
#   * :import_incomplete - Not all items in this import job have been successfully processed.
#
#   * :in_progress - Returned for any other status
#
#   * :validate_error - An error has occurred during validation, such as the
#                       STOMP client not being connected
#
#   * :import_error - An error has occurred during import, such as the
#                     STOMP client not being connected
