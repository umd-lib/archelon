#
#   * :publish_pending - A "publish" request has been sent to Plastron, but
#                       no response has been received.
#
#   * :publish_complete - All items in this import job have been successfully processed.
#
#   * :publish_imcomplete - Not all items in this import job have been successfully processed.
#
#   * :publish_in_progress - Returned for any other status
#
#   * :publish_error - An error has occurred during publish, such as the
